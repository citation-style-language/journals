### Initial data

For MDPI I copy/pasted the journals from their 2012 flyer:

### Adjustments

After running the script, one of the journals caused a problem with the current repository: the journal with title "International Journal of Geo-Information", as listed in `_journals.tab`, is the same as an already existing journal "ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information" from the CSL repository. From the web site at http://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijgi, I concluded the latter title is the correct one, and I adjusted the `_journals.tab` file accordingly.
