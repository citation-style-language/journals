List of journals added by Rintze, who contacted the Future Science Group (http://www.future-science-group.com/)

In the XLS file, grey are discontinued journals, red are new ones. Rintze added metadata for the journals, based on this list. The parent was renamed from "future-medicine-journals" to "future-science-group". The grey journals were added to the _skip.txt file, and removed them from _journals.tab as well.
